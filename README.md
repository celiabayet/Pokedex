## Improve dev environment

1. Communication : Regular meetings with the team to set what has to be done and asking questions when problems have been encounter
2. Use a Kaban Board to organise the team sprints (AGILE method)
  Ideally a product owner or equivalent should set clear sprints to let the devs focus on developping tasks
3. When devolopping use git versionning, one branch per feature.
